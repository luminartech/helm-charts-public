# Cert Manager Module Chart

# Cross-Account DNS Zone Management

Module shold allow sharing/using Route53-hosted DNS zone between AWS accounts.

You would need 2 application(sets) deployed:
1. 1+ instances with deploymentType set to issuer in AWS account that will use DNS shared zone
3. One cert-manager itself (deploymentType set to "app") in client account with next policy override:
   ```
   Policy:
     items:
       _:
         forProvider:
           policy:
             Statement:
               allowAssumeRole:
                 Effect: Allow
                 Action: sts:AssumeRole
                 # We would like to provide as least privileges as possible
                 Resource:
                   - 'arn:aws:iam::<ZoneHostAccountId>:role/<ZoneHostClientSpecificIAMRoleName>'
   ```
